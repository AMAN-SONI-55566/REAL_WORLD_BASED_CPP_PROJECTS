## 🧠 Skills Demonstrated

- **C++ STL** – `vector`, `pair`, `string`, `map`
- **I/O Formatting** – `setw`, `setprecision`, `fixed`
- **Problem Decomposition** – Breaking large tasks into functions
- **User Interaction** – Console-based input/output design
- **Project Structure** – Organized file and naming conventions

---

## 🛠️ Getting Started

### Prerequisites

- C++ compiler like `g++`

### Compile & Run Example

```bash
g++ Receipt_Generator.cpp -o receipt
./receipt
```
````

---

## 🎯 Purpose

This project repo is a part of my ongoing learning journey in **C++**. These mini-projects are aimed at mastering syntax, logic-building, and real-world thinking — making me job-ready for roles involving C++ and software problem-solving.

---

## 🌱 Future Plans

- Add README files per project
- Extend some apps with file storage (like login or grade analyzer)
- Add OOP-based versions for a few projects
- GUI versions using Qt or SFML
